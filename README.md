# Handwritten_Digit_recognition
Developed a multi-model system for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. Implemented and compared four deep learning architectures: CNN, InceptionV3, VGG16, and VGG19. Achieved a maximum accuracy of 99% with CNN. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models in classifying handwritten digits with minimal preprocessing, highlighting their potential for real-world applications.
In this project, we developed and implemented a handwritten digit recognition system that utilizes machine learning techniques to classify digits from 0 to 9. The model was trained on a standard dataset (such as MNIST), achieving a high accuracy rate in recognizing handwritten digits. The system successfully demonstrated the capability of machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning models, to identify digits with minimal preprocessing. The results show that with proper training and fine-tuning, such models can perform reliably and accurately in real-world applications.
